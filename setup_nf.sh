#   -c nextflow.config

# Pointing towards the nextflow.config file will contain all the necessary predefined parameters needed for stating the references
# for a DNA analysis

# The config file will then need to be adjusted with the correct paths to the references

# This will download the reference data for a run using the GRCh37_hmf reference genome
# The samplesheet.csv file is a file that contains the information about the samples 
# that will be used in the analysis - only the references needed for that type of analysis will be downloaded
# The samplesheet file is a CSV file with the following columns: 
# group_id,subject_id,sample_id,sample_type,sequence_type,filetype,filepath
# In this workshop, it will only be done for the COLOMini sample, from bam
# The sampelsheet should be stored in the same directory as that this script

# Extra: Running the test profile

# Using the staged references will required the creation of a nextflow.config file
# to point each individual references (otherwise the pipeline 
# will download the references again)

# The following Nextflow commands can be used for running the test profile

# echo "Running test profile for nf-core/oncoanalyser..."
